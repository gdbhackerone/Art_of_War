# 🧠 Day 01 – Know the Enemy, Know Yourself

### 🏯 **Golden Point from _The Art of War_**
> “If you know the enemy and know yourself, you need not fear the result of a hundred battles.”  
> — *Sun Tzu*

### 🔍 **Cybersecurity Interpretation**

In the SOC battlefield:

- **Know the Enemy** → Understand adversaries' tools, tactics, and motivations.
    - Use threat intelligence feeds (e.g., MISP, AlienVault OTX).
    - Track CVEs, IOCs, and exploit trends via trusted sources.
    - Map observed threats to **MITRE ATT&CK** techniques.
  
- **Know Yourself** → Understand your internal landscape.
    - Maintain real-time **asset visibility** (EDR, NDR, CMDB).
    - Continuously evaluate detection capabilities across SIEM rules and EDR signals.
    - Conduct regular detection gap analysis and coverage reviews.

### ⚔️ **Daily SOC Mindset Boost**

- ✅ Review yesterday’s critical alerts. Classify and correlate with known attacker behaviors (e.g., MITRE T1059 – Command and Scripting Interpreter).
- ✅ Pick one internal server or high-value asset. Audit its logging, detection rules, and EDR coverage.
- ✅ Check threat intelligence platforms for any new relevant IOCs or CVEs tied to recent campaigns.

### 📌 Quote Reflection

> Just as a general studies the terrain and weather before battle, a SOC analyst must study both **internal defenses** and **external threats**. Awareness is your first line of defense.
